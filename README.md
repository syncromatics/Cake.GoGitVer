## Quickstart

This section should get the reader into using the software as quickly as possible. Favor examples over exposistion. For example:

Add the `ThingClient` package to your project:

dotnet add package ThingClient
```

Then use it to do a thing:

```csharp
var client = new ThingClient.Client();
var result = await client.DoThing();
if (result.HasThing)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"The result is {result.Message}");
}
```

If available, add a link to other documentation for this software. Avoid documenting the entire project in this README.
